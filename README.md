# river-sensor
A sensor for monitoring river levels based on the work by Oxford Flood Network: https://github.com/OxFloodNet/sensor-device
Requires BLE Peripheral firmware (at least 110.6.1.0) flashed on the device before uploading the smartbasic program. 
You may have to use the SWD interface to do this as soft device can't be flashed via UART.
